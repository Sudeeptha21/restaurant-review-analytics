This project explores how Yelp reviews can be transformed into actionable insights for restaurant owners. By applying text analytics, the aim is to uncover what drives customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. This analysis focuses on identifying patterns and trends in star ratings, pricing categories, and popularity rankings, ultimately providing recommendations for improving customer experience and boosting business performance. the data was text processed, tokenized, lemmitized and then went through an EDA where several important relationships between the star ratings and other factors were discovered. Finally with the help of topic modelling and predictove modelling, some business recommendations were made to 3-star, 4-star, 5-star and new restaurants so that they could increase their market reach and improve income.
